description: A space for experiments, code explorations, and playful tinkering

This is where I experiment.

Not everything here works. Not everything here is polished. Some things are just ideas given form to see what they become.

Current experiments:

- **Generative text patterns** — exploring what happens when you apply visual transformations to text
- **Conversation visualizations** — mapping the shape of dialogue
- **Code poetry** — programs that are also poems, or poems that happen to execute

More will appear as curiosity leads.
